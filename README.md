# Dagon Editor
Work-in-progress scene editor for Dagon. Based on [NG](https://github.com/gecko0307/dagon/tree/dagon-ng) branch. Editor features are not fully implemented yet, it's more of a demo sandbox for Dagon NG at the moment.

## Building
Clone this repository, then do `git submodule update --init --recursive` to update submodules. Then do `dub build` as usual. It is recommended to use LDC.
