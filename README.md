## Building
Run `dub build` as usual. It is recommended to use LDC and ` --build=release-nodounds` to get the best performance. On Linux and other non-Windows systems you should install Freetype and [Nuklear](https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear). The demo can work without Nuklear, but in that case UI will not be available.
